# gen_plot.f90
generates gnuplot script files to see the tempearture distribution files generated by Two-Temperature-Model (TTM) calculation.

Temperature distribution files are
```
 fort.4001, fort.4002, fort.4003, ....
```
and the total number of files is controled by the inupt parameter *obs_samp_em*.

## Compilation
```
$ ifort -o gen_plot gen_plot.f90 
```

## Execution and gnuplot

Execution should be performed in the directory which includes *fort.4001, fort.4002, ...* files.
Run the following command, and then you prompted one parameter *the total number of files*.
```
$ ./gen_plot
 number of data = ?
```

In put the number, and you get *plot1* and *plot2* for the 3D surface and contour plot. These files can be used as
```
$ gnuplot
gnuplot> load 'plot1'
```
Push return key, you can see the next figure at the next sampling time.
