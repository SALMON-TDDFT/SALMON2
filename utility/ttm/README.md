"gen_plot.f90" generates gnuplot scripts to see the tempearture distribution files generated by TTM calculation.

Temperature distribution files are

 fort.4001, fort.4002, fort.4003, ....

and the total number of files is controled by the inupt parameter obs_samp_em.


*******************
*** Compilation ***
*******************

$ ifort -o gen_plot gen_plot.f90 


**************************
*** Execution and Plot ***
**************************

Execution should be performed in the directory which includes fort.4001, fort.4002, ... files.

$ ./gen_plot

one parameter, the total number of files, is necessary to finish the program.
Then you get plot1 and plot2 for 3D surface and contour plot. These files can be used as

$ gnuplot
gnuplot> load 'plot1'

Push return key, and you can see the next figure at the next sampling time.
